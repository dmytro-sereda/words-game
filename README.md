# Words Game

Managed to create a game that helps expand person's vocabulary. Application was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Managed requests to the 3rd party API with built-in ES6 featute fetch. The game was built with the use of MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and OOP (Object Oriented Programming) paradigm. Since state management wasn't a big process, simple JavaScript object was used. In the updated version timer was added in order to make the game harder.
